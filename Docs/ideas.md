This file contains just ideas. They might turn out to be nothing - that's fine. It's a place for unowned "todos" and capturing feedback. Some red herrings are there just to remind this list is not commitments!

If you decide to do something from here, remove it from here. If you find something from here that's obsolete... remove it from here!

1. Add more randomness and variety to the falling bubbels animation
2. Add RTS mode
3. Allow controls configuration
4. Ensure game is colorblind friendly
5. Improve bubbel popping animation - a bit more randomness, a bit more "umph", spatial sound effects (from source), escalating sound effects (more popped in one go = more wheee) 
6. Support re-theming easily - different art, sound
7. Allow player to choose difficulty
8. Standard "exit" dialogs (especially important for platforms without a "close" button)
9. Add option to adjust audio volume/mute
10. Refactorings
   1. The cannon
   2. Bubbel falling/popping particle engines (are they even needed? each animating bubbel could be self-contained)
