# Bubbel
Bubbel is a "bubbel shooter" clone, with a focus on ironing out some annoyances like when bubbles stick in the wrong place.

## Getting started

In the main branch (Unity version), simply open the project in Unity, open the scene (MainScene) and hit play. Everything should just work. Using Unity version 2021-3-6f1

The game is played with cursor keys to aim and spacebar to fire a Bubbel.

## Contributing

This project is far from exemplary for contributions, but if you see some changes you'd like to make, surprise me.

Known issues/enhancements are in Github issue tracker, https://github.com/Bomadeno/Bubbel/issues

There is a scratchpad [Ideas](Docs/ideas.md) too.



## History

I started this project in the summer of 2010, after graduating and before getting my first job. It was built with XNA framework - which was easier than my previous work with MOGRE.

Unfortunately for bubbel, XNA was deprecated shortly afterwards. Being a "unity person" I ignored the appearance of Monogame completely (which looks like it would have been an easier port) and rebuilt it in Unity. Why Unity? Well, firstly, I didn't know monogame existed, but in hindsight, I'm happy with the decision, because Unity offers great menu support out of the box (Canvas) and very little fiddling with asset load/unload. Which I'm ok doing when needed, but it slows down the creative "make the game" bit.
